###Encrpytion/Decryption:
 Data Encryption Standard, Triple Data Encryption Standard and Advanced Encryption Standard

 ### PLEASE NOTE: pycrypto and pycryptodomex are NOT SAFE. I HIGHLY recommend running a virtual file.

 I used the following libraries:
    1. pycrptodome
    2. pycryptodomex
    3. cryptography
    4. pyaes
    5. pbkdf2

All of these libraries can be installed by using the terminal.

All files can be downloaded or used, as it's recommended to download them and then run them to see what is happening and how the programs work. The first program is encrpyting a message using a default data encryption standard, while the second program is using a triple data encryption standard. Lastly, the Advanced Encryption Standard and uses multiple keys to decrypt the message, which is most secure.
